For this Challenge we need to create three servers, a NAS shareand a LTM:
 Server Names:
  Linux - Wevrt68398
  Windows - Wevet68399
  MySQL - Dbvrt68322

LTM - Iacw.uhc.com

When creating the NAS I was running into errors:
  Unsupported block type

  on nas_nas_0.tf line 1:
   1: IACresource "optumnas_resourcenas" "nas_nas_0" {

  Blocks of type "IACresource" are not expected here.
So the NAS did not get created.

I know this was suppose to be a team event and the Mountaineers team have been very busy on the OTL Lab project.  So when we had time to gather we brainstorm and came up with above scripts.
